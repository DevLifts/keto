    1.1 lb ground/mince beef
    14 oz tinned/canned tomatoes diced
    1/2 tsp chilli powder, or to taste
    1 tbsp tomato paste

Instructions

    Nacho Meat Sauce

        Gently fry the diced onion in oil until clear then add the meat, breaking it up into tiny pieces as it cooks and browns. This should take up to 5 minutes.

        Add the spices and tinned/canned tomato and tomato paste. Stir then simmer on a low heat for 15 minutes (uncovered to thicken the meat sauce) whilst you make the Fat Head tortilla chips and toppings.

    Fat Head Tortilla Chips

        Mix the shredded/grated cheese and almond flour/meal in a microwaveable bowl. Add the cream cheese. Microwave on HIGH for 1 minute.

        Stir then microwave on HIGH for another 30 seconds. Remove and stir again. Add the egg, salt, and spices. Mix.

        Place the Fat Head pastry between 2 pieces of baking parchment/paper and roll into a thin, rectangle (see photos here). Remove the top baking paper/parchment. 

        Slide the baking paper/parchment with the Fat Head pastry, on a baking tray (cookie tray) or pizza stone, and bake at 220C/425F for 12-15 minutes, or until browned on the top. Flip the FatHead pastry over (onto baking paper/parchment) and brown the other side.

        Once cooked, remove from the oven and cut into tortilla chip triangle shapes.  Bake again at 220C/425F for 3 - 5 minutes.

    Putting It All Together

        Place a handful of Fat Head tortilla chips on a plate or serving dish.

        Spoon the hot meat sauce over the tortilla chips.

        Add the grated/shredded cheese which will melt on the hot meat sauce all by itself, then top with everything you love. Serve with a big side salad and plenty of olive oil (optional).

Recipe Notes

    Fat Head pastry can also be made by replacing the almond meal/flour with 1/4 cup (4 tbsp) coconut flour.
