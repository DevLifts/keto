Hidden carbs
    Keeping to a low carb diet is hard enough but when you realy dig deep, you have to watch for hidden sources of carbs you might not have thought of before. Diet soda's, sugar free food, 'naturally sweetned' beverages are all suspects for adding hidden carbs to your carb count! Most natural sweeteners (Table Sugar, Honey, Xylitol) all contain carbs, as do the majority of artificial sweeteners! Before consuiming anything that isn't water, check and double check the nutrient list, generally, the a list will start with the ingredient that has the highest concentration first and end with trace ingredients so if you see sugar as the first or one of the first items listed, stay away!

Safe, now carb sweeteners
    Natural sweeteners vary a lost in taste and aftertase, stevia having a slightly bitter taste while Allulose taste the most similar to table sugar. All of following contain fewer than 35 net carbs per 100g, ordered from fewest to highest:
        Insulin
        Allulose
        Stevia
        Monk Fruit
        Tagatose

Sweeteners to stay clear from
    Processed table sugar contains as many as 100 carbs per 100g, so steer well clear of anything that even has a trace amount in it! Other high carb sweeteners often found in sodas and pre-cooked food are:
        Saccharin
        Aspartame
        Maltitol
        Xylitol
    All alcoholic beverages also contain high quantities of carbs in the form of sugar, so it's best to avoid these completely. If you need to have a drink or two, stick with the dry variants as these generally have lower sugar content.
