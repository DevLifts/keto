Bacon and Egg Cups

    1 pack high quality, no sugar added bacon
    salted butter
    1 muffin tin
    6-12 eggs (1 per cup in muffin tin)
    salt and pepper (optional)

Filling Options

    pico de gallo
    salsa
    shredded/grated cheese
    jalape√±os
    spinach
    kale
    mushroom
    chorizo
    chopped bacon (great if you have some left over from your cups)

Instructions

    Lightly grease a muffin tin with butter (I prefer [Kerrygold](https://www.kerrygoldusa.com/))

    Cut bacon strips in half and place bacon in an X in each muffin cup (2 to 3 pieces should cover most of the cup)

    Bake on 400 for 10 minutes (be sure to leave oven on)

    Once the bacon is done cooking add fillings to cup, be sure to leave about 1/2 an inch to accommodate eggs.

    Crack an egg over each cup and pour out the egg slowly, this will allow the whites to seep into the fillings and make them less likely to spill over.

    Salt and pepper eggs to taste.

    If you are using cheese feel free to top the eggs for an extra cheesy result.

    Bake the cups for another 10 to 12 minutes. (If you like runny yolks be sure to check often to prevent over cooking.)

    Use a knife to separate the bacon from pan (if needed) and use tongs to remove the cups.

    Enjoy!

Recipe Notes

    If you are using cheese, I like to add it to my fillings and top the eggs with it. CHEESE!
