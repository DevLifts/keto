## What is Keto

A Keto or Ketogneic Diet is a low carbohydrate diet, that causes the body to produce ketones.

Ketones are water-soluble molecules that are produced by the liver during low carbohydrate diets, and is used to fuel the body when glucose is less available than normal.

When you eat something high in carbohydrate your body will create glucose and insulin, and since your body is using glucose as a primary energy source it will store fats.

If you can produce less glucose in your system, your body will start to use ketones to brake down fat and use that as energy to fuel your body.
